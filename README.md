Project Description
ITess movies allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater. There are four available movies and each has its own show time and available number of tickets. On the first movie details the information that displays about the movie when the page loads are: poster of the movie,Title,runtime, showtime and available tickets. the tickets available will also display which will clearly tell the maximum number of people it can accomodate.
A get request was done on th db.json to retrieve the data. Upon clicking the submit button, you will see the tickets available decrease in number. if there are 0 tickets available one should not be able to buy tickets, instead it should display "sold out"
